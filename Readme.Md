### Context

I believe news articles are rich in grammar and vocabulary which allows us to gain greater insights.I have taken the webscraped data set from Kaggle.Downloaded and worked on the data set and made it ready for seq2seq model which further will squeez out summarized output from the big corpora of the article. 

### Content

The dataset consists of 4515 examples and contains Author_name, Headlines, Url of Article, Short text, Complete Article.the Kaggler gathered the summarized news from Inshorts and only scraped the news articles from Hindu, Indian times and Guardian.  Time period ranges from febrauary to august 2017.

### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the kaggler and  authors of Inshorts for their amazing work

### Inspiration

* Generating short length descriptions(headlines) from text(news articles).
* Summarizing large amount of information which can be represented in compressed space.

### Purpose

When I was working on the summarization task I didn't find any open source data-sets to work on, I believe there are people just like me who are working on these tasks and I hope it helps them.

### Contributions

It will be really helpful if anyone found nice insights from this data. Thankyou...!!!
